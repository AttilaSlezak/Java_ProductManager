# Java_Week10A_ProductManager
Practice to use abstraction and interfaces in Java.

In this task I had to upgrade my "Movie" application (written previous week) to a "Product Manager" application which is now able to calculate prices and investments of buyable products. In the exercise I had to use abstract classes, interfaces and inheritance. In this store there are 3 types of products: movie, game and book. People can rent any type of products, but can buy only movies and games: books are only rentable. Every product has an identifier which is generated by the application itself.

The UML diagram of this application can be found in UML_ProductManager.jpg.
